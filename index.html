              <h3>Birthday Simulator</h3>

              <p>
               The goal of this project was to create a simulation that tests the Birthday Paradox. This Paradox states that the probability that two people in a room
                will have the same birthday is more than half if the number of people in the room is more than 23. Although this paradox seems very counterintuitive,
                it has been proven to be true.
              </p>
              <p>
              The functional requirements of this project were to write a program that simulates multiple trials where a set number of people are randomly assigned birthdays,
                then checks if any two people share the same one. Using these simulations, we calculate the probability of at least one match occurring. The project consists
                of several key components: the Birthday class, which generates realistic random birthdays, the Trial class, which runs individual simulations to check for shared
                birthdays, and the Experiment class, which performs multiple trials to estimate probabilities. By running different experiments with varying group sizes, users can see how
                quickly the chances of shared birthdays increase. This project is both a great demonstration of probability theory and a way to challenge human intuition about randomness.
              </p>
              <p>
              While working on this project, I was able to implement new processes that I had learned. I was responsible for implementing the framework code for the Birthday, Trial, and Experiment
                class. While working on the implementations of these classes, I practiced writing clean, efficient code. To test these classes, specifically the Birthday and Trial class, I was responsible
                for implementing JUnit tests. In these tests, I used Mockito to mock a Random object so that I could test if the methods would work on both base cases
                and edge cases. Additionally, in this project, my partner and I implemented successful pair programming to utilize the best of skills and allocate them to specific tasks. Pair
                programming allowed us to work more efficiently and effectively on tasks that we were stronger in, and seek out the other's help if needed.
              </p>
              <p>
              The Birthday Paradox project helped me get a better understanding of the benefits of JUnit testing. After writing our initial JUnit tests, we went back and refactored our code so that
                our tests would pass. This allowed me to better identify the mistakes or inefficiencies in the initial code and figure out exactly where it needed to be refactored. Writing JUnit tests
                and implementing test-driven development is something that I will continue to improve as I enhance my programming skills.
              </p>

                <h3>Elevator Simulator</h3>

                <p>
                  The Elevator Scheduling Simulator is a Java program that models how elevators operate in a multi-story building. It simulates four types of elevators: standard,
                  freight, express, and penthouse elevators, each with their own unique behavior. The simulator assigns elevator calls based on different scheduling strategies (simple and complex) and
                  runs over multiple time steps, printing the state of each elevator at each round. The goal is to provide a realistic, extensible framework for testing elevator assignment
                  strategies and logic.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This project is designed to mimic how real elevators would respond to floor calls in a building. A call is a request from one floor to another just like pressing the button in an elevator.
                  When the simulation starts, it assigns these calls to elevators using either a simple scheduler, which assigns the first available elevator, or a complex scheduler, which picks the best
                  elevator based on proximity and direction. Each elevator then “moves” one floor at a time toward picking up or dropping off passengers. The program prints elevator status and keeps track
                  of unassigned calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The project uses object-oriented design principles such as inheritance and polymorphism to make the code modular and extendable. I was responsible for implementing the framework code for the
                  SimpleElevatorScheduler and ComplexElevatorScheduler classes as well as the ElevatorScheduler interface. ElevatorScheduler was used to decouple the scheduling logic from the elevators themselves,
                  promoting separation of concerns and allowing the easy addition of new schedulers. The main class, ElevatorSimulator, represented the "brain" of the system and coordinated all of the parts together.
                  In addition, I was also responsible for writing JUnit tests for all of these classes and was required to work well in collaboration with my partner using good teamwork practices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This project helped me deepen my understanding of object-oriented design and the importance of clean abstractions. I got better at writing and organizing unit tests and learned how to simulate
                  state changes in a complex system. Working through input parsing, immutability errors, and method overrides taught me to be more detail-oriented with Java. I also learned how to design for
                  extensibility—if we wanted to add more elevator types or behaviors, the project could handle that smoothly.
